Hello!
My name is Lucas Trabuchi.

I use my own project to show you how I write the test cases.
This is the project that I use for freelance projects.
So, let's run the test case... but
How do we run the test case?

## First of all We have to open a new terminal and run the command:

```bash
npm install
```

## After that the next script that we need to run is:

```bash
npm wd-pro
```

## And then you'll want to run your/mine test case, so we have to run:

```bash
npm run start clarkTest (clarkTest is the name of the suite, we have that in clark.conf.ts)
```

## And the last one (only you want to see a nice report you can run)

```bash
npm run generate-report && npm run open-report
```
